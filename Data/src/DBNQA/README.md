# How to run

DBNQA is a HUGE dataset, we would need to use Git LFS to handle it. The original repo is included as a submodule, and you can download the data [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Question-NSpM_SPARQL_dataset_EN_/6118505)

Put both the data.en and data.sparql data files in a folder called:

`raw_data/DBNQA/`

and create an out_data folder called:

`out_data/DBNQA/`
